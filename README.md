## About ##

Greetings! My name is Devin Sinitiere. I am an aspiring software engineer from Las Vegas, NV. I have been coding for approximately 7 years now in my free time. Only recently have I decided to turn my passion for software development into a viable career path by enrolling in GA Tech's Coding Bootcamp. While I am relatively new to the field of
web development I have up to intermediate level knowledge in a variety of programming languages including: x86 Assembly, C, C++, C#, LUA, JS, etc.
